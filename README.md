# Spam Mail Detector

This project is a Python-based application for spam mail detection using a Naive Bayes algorithm. It analyzes email content and identifies spam emails with a high degree of accuracy.

## Description

The Spam Mail Detector utilizes a Naive Bayes algorithm to classify emails as either spam or non-spam based on their content. It achieved 90% accuracy in spam detection, using keyword repetition analysis with a low false positive rate (FPR).

## Features

- **Spam Detection**: Classifies emails as spam or non-spam with 90% accuracy.
- **Keyword Analysis**: Analyzes email content for keyword repetition to identify spam.
- **Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib for visualizing performance metrics and optimizing model accuracy.
- **Dataset**: Processed over 10,000 emails from a curated dataset to train and test the model.

## Technology Stack

- Python
- Naive Bayes Algorithm
- Matplotlib
